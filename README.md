# Atmospheric Temperature Reduction Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates the process of reducing atmospheric temperature over a specified area using ground heat exchange. It calculates the number of holes required to be drilled into the ground to achieve a 1Â°C temperature reduction over one square mile of area.

## Key Features

- Calculates the mass of air over a given area
- Determines the energy required to lower the temperature
- Simulates heat transfer through drilled holes
- Estimates the number of holes needed for the desired temperature reduction
- Provides additional practical information such as hole spacing and fan power requirements

## How It Works

The simulation follows these main steps:

1. Calculate the total mass of air over the specified area
2. Determine the energy required to lower the air temperature
3. Calculate the heat transfer rate for a single hole
4. Estimate the energy removed by one hole over a month
5. Calculate the total number of holes required
6. Provide additional practical information

## Assumptions and Limitations

- This would only work for areas/times with hot atmospheres (>10-15 degrees Celsius)
- The model assumes constant heat transfer along the entire depth of the hole
- Air properties are based on standard atmospheric conditions
- Ground temperature is assumed to be constant
- The simulation doesn't account for environmental factors like wind or solar radiation

## Usage

To run the simulation:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system
2. Run the script using: `python drilling_atmospheric_temperature.py`

## Future Improvements

- Implement a more sophisticated heat transfer model
- Account for varying ground temperatures at different depths
- Consider the impact of hole proximity on heat transfer efficiency
- Incorporate environmental factors for more accurate results
